## File Naming Rules

⚠️ **Important:** Android resource files must:
- Be lowercase only
- Use underscores, not spaces or hyphens
- Not start with numbers
- Be in MP3 or OGG format

✅ **Correct:** `sound_focus_start.mp3`  
❌ **Wrong:** `Sound-Focus-Start.mp3`, `1_focus_start.mp3`

## Testing

After adding sound files:
1. Clean and rebuild the project in Android Studio
2. The sounds will be automatically loaded by `SoundManager.kt`
3. Test each sound:
   - Start Focus → should play water drop
   - Pause Focus → should play bamboo tap
   - Complete Focus → should play bird chirp + chime
   - Cancel Focus → should play leaf rustle
